SudokuSolver

Initially built in 2006, I wrote this program when Sudoku craze started and I got frustrated by the rote application of predetermined tools.

Early versions relied on a brute force splitting of boards and recursively finding the valid solutions amongst the many possible combinations.

The program has evolved to incorporate more deterministic strategies so that very few (only the most difficult) puzzles still rely on branching the board and solving recursively.
